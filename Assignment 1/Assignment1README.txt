Instructions:

Objective:
Create a C program that simulates a basic Student Grades Management System. This system will allow the user to:

Input and validate data (names, grades).
Perform arithmetic operations (average, total).
Make decisions based on conditions (e.g., pass/fail).
Implement loops to process multiple students.
Use different data types (integers, floats, chars) effectively.
This assignment will test your understanding of the concepts introduced in Weeks 1 to 5 of the course.

Additionally, you will be required to record a short video explaining your program, showing the code, and demonstrating its functionality. You will also need to upload your code to GitHub and share the link.

Problem Description:
You are tasked to build a simple command-line program for a school to manage student grades. The program should:

Prompt the user to input student details (name, grades for 3 subjects).
Validate the input, ensuring grades are between 0 and 100.
Calculate and display:
Total marks for each student.
Average marks.
Whether the student has passed or failed (average ≥ 50 is a pass).
Allow the user to process grades for multiple students until they choose to stop.
Display a summary at the end with the number of students processed and their average grades.
Requirements:
Input & Output

Use scanf and printf for input/output operations.
Display the data in a user-friendly format.
Conditions (if, if-else)

Use conditions to determine if the input grades are valid (0-100).
Determine whether the student passes or fails.
Loops (for, while)

Use a loop to process data for multiple students until the user chooses to stop.
Data Types

Use appropriate types:
char for the student’s name.
float for average grades.
int for individual grades and total marks.

Instructions:

You are tasked with completing a program using the topics covered in Module 3. Follow these exact requirements to ensure your submission is complete.

1. Program Requirements
You must write a program in C that performs the following tasks:

Floating-Point Values:
Declare two float variables and assign them real numbers.

Calculate the sum, difference, multiplication, and division of these numbers.

Print the results, formatted to display two decimal places.

Arithmetic Operators:
Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of a division involving two integers.

Print the result.

Character Data Type (char):
Declare a char variable and assign it a letter (e.g., 'A').

Print the character and its ASCII value using %c and %d.

Input and Output with printf() and scanf():
Prompt the user to input an integer and a float.

Print the values entered by the user.

Increment/Decrement Operations:
Declare an integer variable and demonstrate the use of pre- and post-increment operators.

Print the value of the variable before and after each operation.

2. Output Formatting:
Use printf() to display results with clear and organized formatting.

Include descriptions for each output (e.g., "The sum is: ...").

3. Comments:
Add comments to explain the purpose of the program and the functionality of each section of the code.

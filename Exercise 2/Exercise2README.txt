Instructions:

You are tasked with completing a specific program using the topics covered in Module 2. Follow these exact requirements to ensure your submission is complete.

1. Program Requirements
You must write a program in C that performs the following:

Use Floating-Point Numbers:

Declare a float variable for the radius of a circle.
Declare a double variable for the constant Pi (
).
Use these variables to calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula:
Demonstrate Type Conversion:

Explicitly convert the floating-point circumference to an integer and store it in a new variable.
Print both the original floating-point value and the integer-converted value.
Use Scientific Notation:

Declare a double variable for Planck’s constant (
) and print its value in scientific notation using %e.
Output Formatting:

Use printf to format and display the results:
The radius of the circle with 2 decimal places.
The floating-point circumference with 3 decimal places.
The integer-converted circumference as an integer.
Planck’s constant in scientific notation.
Comments:

Add comments to explain the purpose of the program and the functionality of each section of code.
